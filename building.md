### Building your robot

Start by building the three-wheeled basis following the steps in the booklet
that is open on the assembly desks. Start at page 13. You should have available
all parts that you need - if not, please ask us.

At the end of this step, your robot should look like on page 21 of the booklet or in other words like this:

<img src="/assets/img/robots/robot28.jpg" style="width: 500px;"/>
<img src="/assets/img/robots/robot27.jpg" style="width: 500px;"/>


### Connect the accelerometer, gyroscope, and compass

As the next step, build a little platform that holds the accelerometer,
gyroscope, and compass. This you will not find in the booklet.

This is how the platform should look:

<img src="/assets/img/robots/robot22.jpg" style="width: 500px;"/>
<img src="/assets/img/robots/robot23.jpg" style="width: 500px;"/>
<img src="/assets/img/robots/robot24.jpg" style="width: 500px;"/>
<img src="/assets/img/robots/robot25.jpg" style="width: 500px;"/>
<img src="/assets/img/robots/robot26.jpg" style="width: 500px;"/>

Once you connect it to the robot, it should look like this:

<img src="/assets/img/robots/robot29.jpg" style="width: 500px;"/>

We want the platform high up to leave room for the Raspberry Pi.


### Connect the Raspberry Pi 3

Now connect the Raspberry Pi:

### Connect all cables

Make sure you connect all cables. Hopefully you can deduce the connections from the following photos
but do not hesitate to ask us:

<img src="/assets/img/robots/robot41.jpg" style="width: 500px;"/>
<img src="/assets/img/robots/robot42.jpg" style="width: 500px;"/>
